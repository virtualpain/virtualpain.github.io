During finishing my work, suddenly dark. All
my backup power machine are beeping. I cursed that  government owned electric company many times.
All my work has been gone.

I was trying to reach the kitchen to get my wax lamp on. Then I noticed some lights from above the kitchen that only covered by some transparent plastic roof.

The star are so pretty.

The sky really clear that night (although it is been raining past few days), I can see the stars in the sky. I suddenly forgot the reality that I am really pissed off about the power outage.

What so interesting? It is just star.

Well, the light pollution from the city has been made us cannot see the star so clearly these days. It is a something I never seen before in my house.

I enjoyed the rest of the night in the dark, made a cup of tea, watch the stars, while watching passerby cars and motorcycles. It got me think: This is what people long ago see in the sky. Before lamp, electricity, digital age come and take over our life.

And also, it got me think, that we are so small. Look at those stars, those tiny thing in the sky actually bigger than our planet, even our sun. What's beyond the galaxy, what's beyond the universe.

Before I finished my thought, the power back on. The stars gone dim, lose againts streets lights, house, big mall in the city. But I know, it is out there. Trying to shine. That's good.
